# Brightness_Detection_CNN


# Please Refer .ipynb file for more detailed version of this project
# Brightness Detection using CNN model

**I have used random images and created my own dataset. Check the .ipynb file to see in more details**

> t1/*.png

# Dataset Information
**Using normal images and converting it into different intensity images**<br>
**Each image has 11 different categories (0-Low , 10 -High)intensity**<br>
**The image shape is (128,128,3)**

# Objective
**To detect the brightness level of an image (0-low, 10- High)**<br>

# Model Used

**Here we have used CNN to learn features and target the dataset**
